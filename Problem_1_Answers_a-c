PROBLEM 1 ANSWERS

A. Explain version control and how it relates to GitHub:
    Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files, and lets the user access information about changes
    that have been made over the course of the project. Version control is at the heart of GitHub, and allows an individual or team
    of people to work on a project without fear of irreparably damaging it. 
      
B. Define a repository and describe how you might use it:
    A repository is an online storage space where you can keep a project, its files, and previous versions of those files. A repository
    can be used as a safe and organized space to keep a project and its files neat and tidy, and accessible by anyone with access.
    
C. Define a branch and describe how you might use it:
    A branch is a an off-shoot of the main or "master" repository, which allows changes to a project to be made without immediately
    committing those changes to the overall project. A branch is useful for allowing members of a team to safely edit and tinker with
    parts of the project. Those edits can then be reviewed and agreed upon before being officially added to the project.
